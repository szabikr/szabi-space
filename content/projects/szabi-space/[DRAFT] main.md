# Approach to software development

On this project the idea is to just build the most simplest solution that works. And if I can avoid writing code, that's even better, hence the reason using aws cli and psql cli instead of implementing everything into the python script.

When I face a problem in a project that is not too easy to solve meaning that I spent one or two days and I did not get any significant progress, I like to take the problem out of its context and solve it as an individual unit. Usually, there is a new technology that is involved so I need to do some research on that new technology and learn about its features, so I go into one of my sandbox repositories and create a new package from scratch that only deals with that specific technology solving the problem at hand.
I document my progress, usually in the package's README.md file and if the solution is interesting enough, I put together a page on my website describing the problem/solution in a detailed way.

If there are more components involved and the solution need several different technologies I might create a proof of concept where everything comes together and an end to end solution is presented, however this is still outside of the main context. Most of the time these proof of concepts deserve an article because they are going to end up presenting a solution that other people might have also and knowledge sharing is one of the key principles that I follow.
