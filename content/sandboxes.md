### Sandbox repos

This list of repositories represent my trial work. Just as you would sit down next to a pyhisical sandbox and start modifying its content, I try out **software technologies**, **programming languages** with the sole purpose of creating and learning.

Some of the repositories contain work that was inspired by tutorials, courses, articles or videos. So you can dig into the `README.md` files and see if you find something useful for yourself to explore.

I itend to come back to the code that's in these repos in case I want to look things up or expand my knowledge by implementing new ideas.
