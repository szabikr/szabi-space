      <h3>Manifesto</h3>
      <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
        <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehansive documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Costumer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
        <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
