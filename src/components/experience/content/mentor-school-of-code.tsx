        Throughout my career I have had a few official/unofficial mentors who
        guided me on my software engineering path and I felt that it was my turn
        to give back to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        School of Code is a 16 week intensive tech bootcamp that focuses on{' '}
        <strong>web developer skills</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and{' '}
        <strong>agile ways of woking</strong>. My responsibility as a Mentor was
        to guide the bootcampers on their journey not only from a technical
        perspective but also from a professional one.
      </p>

        I helped three people from different backgrounds to understand the
        fundamentals of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>JSX</strong>, the
        mechanics of <strong>React</strong> such as props propagation,
        conditional rendering, state management and common hooks. On the backend
        we looked at <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> in the popular Express.js
        framework and some basic SQL queries. Finally, I supported them to
        deploy their solutions on Netlify and Heroku.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along side the technical challenges we had discussions about the
        different types of tech organisations out there and finding out what
        would be the best first step in their careers. I provided my
        professional experiences as an example to describe what it means to work
        in the software engineering industry and what are the roles within an
        Agile team.
      </p>
      <p>
        This side job was a great experience and I am looking forward to
        mentoring junior to mid level developers in the future.
