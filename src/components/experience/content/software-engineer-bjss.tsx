        Up until this point I was working mainly with start-ups and smaller
        companies and I wanted to learn how a well established consultancy does
        things in the engineering and project delivery space.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first project at the company was a{' '}
        <strong>digital transformation</strong>, Driving Examiner Services, that
        currently allows driving examiners across the UK to conduct driving
        tests on an iPad saving hundreds of thousands of paper each year. The
        application makes driving examiners' lives easier by digitising the exam
        process and the exam itself smoother for the candidates, reducing weeks
        of delay between the tests and results.

        The client's requirement was for us to use the{' '}
        <strong>Ionic framework</strong> for building the application, and our
        solutions architect chose a serverless, microservices architecture in
        the <strong>AWS</strong> cloud. At the time Ionic was only supporting{' '}
        <strong>Angular</strong> so we bit the bullet and got the most out of
        the framework that we could. The application had to deal with a complex
        state, handling 12 different categories and working in situations where
        the device did not have internet connection, so we picked{' '}
        <strong>NgRx</strong> as the central nervous system of our solution.{' '}
        <strong>TypeScript</strong> was used to build a robust schema oriented
        codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was working very closely with the Product Design team, first to
        understand their User Research and make sure that we are building the
        right thing. And second, to implement our component library that
        followed the <strong>Government Digital Service</strong> guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        To deliver the product MVP, we worked in a scaled <strong>Scrum</strong>{' '}
        environment that we called <strong>Nexus</strong>, held a demonstration
        event every two weeks to keep our client in the loop and gather valuable
        feedback. As a team, we built our repositories{' '}
        <strong>open-source</strong>; reviewed and merged multiple{' '}
        <strong>Pull Requests</strong> each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 18 months of hard work, the client's in-house software engineering
        team took over the development, inviting me to join them for 6 more
        months and complete the <strong>project handover</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hands down this project was my favourite and most successful work in the
        first 5 years of my career. And I consider myself lucky for having the
        opportunity to work alongside extremely talented people.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my final year at the company I tried to switch things up so I moved
        to Birmingham and participated in a few small to mid scale projects,
        developing solutions on the front-end. One project in particular had a
        very well designed <strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong> so I had the chance
        to experience the benefits of such a process.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 3 years into the consultancy business I decided to take a brake,
        focus more on my health and fitness, reconnect with old friends & family
        and build a few projects for myself (including this website), so I
        handed in my notice.
