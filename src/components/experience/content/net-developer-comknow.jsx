        Fresh out of University, I was eager to start my job as a .Net
        Developer. Coming from a <strong>C/C++ background</strong> I was excited
        to build real world applications using the <strong>C#</strong> language,
        version 6.0 just came out at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this company I was introduced to the{' '}
        <strong>3 Tier Architecture</strong> (Presentation - Business - Data)
        that gave a standardised approach to most of the projects that I worked
        on. I quickly realised that the Data Access and Business Logic layers
        were highly coupled and made it very difficult to test our code.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing some research, I found that this issue can be solved by
        implementing the{' '}
        <strong>Unit of Work and Generic Repository Pattern</strong> and with
        that we had the necessary abstractions to isolate and test our layers.
        We also made our code more easy to change for any future client
        requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, I dipped my toes into the world of Front-end
        development and started to get familiar with <strong>JavaScript</strong>{' '}
        (well, as familiar as one can get with the language before ES6) and used{' '}
        <strong>jQuery</strong> to make the UI more interactive and handle{' '}
        <strong>AJAX</strong> requests.
