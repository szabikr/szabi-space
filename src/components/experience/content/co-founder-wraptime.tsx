        A friend of mine had an idea to build an application for allowing
        recreational football teams to find additional players and players to
        find teams. Later on we realised that the app was going to be useful for
        any team sport. We called it <strong>Instaplay</strong>.

      <p>
        This opportunity came at the right time as I just finished with my
        previous job and wanted a challenge. I moved to Nottingham, lived with
        my three co-founders and we worked pretty much every day to release the
        Application by the time the University of Nottingham, our first and only
        client, started their football and netball leagues.
      </p>

        I insta realised (pun intended) that if we want to achieve our deadline
        we need to break down the features into bite-sized tasks, then estimate
        and prioritise them. So I was eager to apply my <strong>Agile</strong>{' '}
        skills and knowledge that I picked up so far. <strong>ZenHub</strong>{' '}
        seemed a great tool for this as we already had our code and issues on{' '}
        <strong>GitHub</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used <strong>React Native</strong> to build the application. At the
        time React Native was heavily in development, sometimes we needed to
        rewrite parts of our codebase to keep up with the latest framework
        version. Implemented a <strong>RESTful API</strong> using{' '}
        <strong>NodeJS</strong> and stored the data in a{' '}
        <strong>MongoDB</strong> instance. To support the app, we developed a
        Portal website in <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>{' '}
        where league organisers could configure the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its peak, the application had over 1000 active users and served to
        run the football and netball leagues for one season at the University of
        Nottingham. Throughout this project I acquired relevant experience in
        JavaScript, Node and React while learning the ins and outs of the{' '}
        <strong>Redux sate management</strong> library.
