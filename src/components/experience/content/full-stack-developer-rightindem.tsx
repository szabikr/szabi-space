        After realising that my previous adventure will not succeed and looking
        at my back account to see a one digit figure only, I quickly started to
        look for opportunities around Nottingham City Centre. RightIndem was a
        perfect fit for me at the time because I could still stay in the
        start-up space but also utilise my freshly acquired front-end skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the organisation, I was responsible for building a One Question Per
        Page front-end solution in <strong>React v15</strong> and work with our
        bespoke, in-house <strong>CQRS</strong> system. Furthermore, I took part
        in discussions about the technical details of our system, product
        roadmap and design decisions. And occasionally, organising darts
        competitions, pool tournaments and staying super late to finish a
        feature for the next day release.

      <p>A few takeaways from this job:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is almost always better to pick an{' '}
          <strong>off-the-shelves framework</strong> for doing the heavy lifting
          on the technical side of your project because other people already
          have had similar problems to you and they developed a solution that is
          well thought out and tested. Focusing most of your efforts on solving
          domain specific problems that are unique to your business is a much
          better use of your time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TDD</strong> works best when building features with well
          defined requirements and most of the underlying technical details are
          fleshed out and solved. It can be a very polarising topic so it's good
          to enter in discussions about it with an open mind. The{' '}
          <strong>Red Green Refactor</strong> approach can be very satisfying.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Agile teams</strong> are all different and while the Scrum or
          any other framework specification is a good place to start you don't
          want to stick with something that doesn't work for you. Iteratively
          improving the ways of working, listening to your mates and having fun
          is the core of any high-achieving, high-trust and fast moving teams.
        </li>
      </ul>
