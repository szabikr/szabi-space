        On a local meet-up I talked about <strong>gamification</strong>, the
        term was relatively new at the time so a representative of Reea
        approached me and offered a spot as an iOS developer at the company.

        Even though Reea wanted me to stay as a full time employee after these
        two months, I decided to keep focusing on my final university year. And
        to be honest, I did not fall in love with Objective-C, but I gained some
        valuable experience in terms of seeing how a Software Agency operates
        and what a <strong>professional work environment</strong> looks like.
