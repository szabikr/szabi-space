        This was my first job in the UK and first time working in a{' '}
        <strong>Agile</strong> environment where we had regular stand-ups and
        other Scrum ceremonies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role was to support a used car sales website that was built using{' '}
        <strong>.Net technologies</strong> and powered by Sitecore CMS. As a
        back-end developer, I got introduced to <strong>Docker</strong> for the
        first time and used <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> to execute our reoccurring
        data import procedure, <strong>MongoDB</strong> for storing data and{' '}
        <strong>ElasticSearch</strong> to query that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the rigorous release process that we used, I had to learn the{' '}
        <strong>Git</strong> version control techniques, some of which I still
        use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, the project that I was hired for fell through, so I decided to
        move on. Before that I had the pleasure of getting a new developer on
        board and teaching them about all the processes and technologies
        involved at the Software Development department of Branded3.
